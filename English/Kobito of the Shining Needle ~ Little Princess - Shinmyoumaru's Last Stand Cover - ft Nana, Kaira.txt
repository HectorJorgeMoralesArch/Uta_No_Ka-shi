Freedom denied
Our people lost their pride
Cast aside
Existence vilified

Bound and tied
Lost our will to fight
Forgotten in time
Our birthright is denied

Burning inside
We will not abide
We shall rise
Our fist towards the skies

Strengths combined
Our will will not be denied
Let fates collide
And freedom realized

Look upon the shackled and opressed
They rise in arms to bring it all to end
One dream we have not forgotten
That one day, all shall look and see us ascend

Come any hurdle or any strife
Blood, Sweat, and Tears, I will make us rise
Higher than clouds, further than the skies
They will look on us with fire in our eyes

No longer shall they make us cry
One last defiance, we will never hide
Though small we are, our spirits are on high
Stand tall, my kin, we shall reach new heights

Despite the tears flowing from my eyes
My heart yearns to end this final fight
My hands shakes with a numbing fright
But I will be brave with all my might

This is where I will make things right
All is decided on this fateful night
The hammer on my left, needle on my right
I shall end the struggle of my kind

Look upon the shackled and opressed
They rise in arms to bring it all to end
One dream we have not forgotten
That one day, all shall look and see us ascend

None shall keep up from our fate
Freedom is worth the sacrifice we will make
Our will is our's to dictate
Now tremble before

THE GREAT INCHLING'S WAKE

Come and hurdle or any strife
Blood, Sweat, and Tears, I will make us rise
Higher than clouds, further than the skies
They will look on us with fire in our eyes

No longer shall they make us cry
One last defiance, we will never hide
Though small we are, our spirits are on high
Stand tall, my kin, we shall reach new heights
