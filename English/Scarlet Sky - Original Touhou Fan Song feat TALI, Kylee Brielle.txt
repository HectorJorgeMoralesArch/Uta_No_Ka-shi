I have watched over the shrine a countless times
I have solved incidentes wherever they arise
I have mantained the balance and had set things right
for I am the maiden of this land of light

so why does it all feel so strange tonight?
feeling of dread yet there is no foe in sight
scarlet tinge then coats the cloudless sky
the air tastes of iron and of rust combined

born from seclusion, this cursed devouring dread
no false illusion, this ever-growing threat
I will break the barrier and choke the air with red
so that I may finally face the bloodied sky

I then take flight, my eyes now alight
with purpose now, an objective in sight
to remove this blight and to keep the balance right
I will uphold my vow, as a maiden of red and white

I arrived at the dreaded red estate
where a gatekeeper with vicous strenght, I would face
my spells were enough to keep her at bay
one should learn to never underestimate

forbidden knowledge will undo your mortal thread
this library is where you will meet your end
just let the scarlet gloom grow and spread
so that she may finally face the bloodied sky

before my eyes was a lady of the knives
whose powers reign over the ebb and flow of time
despite her might, I must steel myself and fight
to remove the fright and to bring back the light

make yourself known, and be prepared to face your end
your minions have fled, now be condemned
amusing how a human had made it this far
though I promise I shall give you more than just scars

we are the ones you should learn not to underestimate
for it could be your last mistake
show me the might of the humans if it holds weight
the victor shall decide this land's final fate

NOW BE UNMADE

I then take flight, my eyes now alight
with purpose now, an objective in sight
to remove this blight and to keep the balance right
I will uphold my vow, as a maiden of red and white

as I turn my eyes towards the twilight sky
I see a child with wings that shine so bright
with purpose now, an objective in sight
I will uphold my vow, as a maiden of red and white
