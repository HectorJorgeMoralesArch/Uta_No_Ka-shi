Bathed in the shining light, you sing
In the lowered eyes of your neighbor
Collect your heartache and turn it into wind
Accept that you have the power to do so

The back I chased after
I could never reach, how long has it been?
Here I stand, nothing has changed
Breathing alone

One day, I will surely show everything
Naturally, I want to call out with my voice
But I feel like I need to get a little stronger
Before that can happen

From the last day we met
How much time has passed, I wonder?
Hey,
Even the words from that day have faded away

But I still dream about it again and again

The back I chased after
I could never reach, how long has it been?
Here I stand, nothing has changed
Breathing alone

One day, I will surely show everything
Naturally, I want to call out with my voice
But I feel like I need to get a little stronger
Before that can happen

Even though vague gestures suit me well
It's probably my fault after all
With this melody that makes my heart skip a beat
I can sway my heart...

The back I chased after
I could never reach, how long has it been?
Here I stand, nothing has changed
Breathing alone

One day, I will surely show everything
Naturally, I want to call out with my voice
But I feel like I need to get a little stronger
Before that can happen

I will change the lies I have collected into truths
Because the truth is a damaging thing
Forever and ever, somewhere
I will always love you

Even if 100 years pass
Or even if it's been 100 years
